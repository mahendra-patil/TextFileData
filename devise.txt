Devise is a flexible authentication solution for Rails based on Warden.

Warden makes it easy to move authentication up into Rack middleware. This means authentication can be accessed outside of a Rails controller such as in routes or in a mountable engine.

  A helper method is a method written for the view, itâ€™s designed to be reusable anywhere within the website, and it cleans up the view code by separating out some logic
